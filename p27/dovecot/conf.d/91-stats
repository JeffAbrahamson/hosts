# Dovecot v2.1+ supports gathering statistics (CPU, disk usage, etc.)
# from mail processes (IMAP, POP3, LMTP, etc.) to the stats
# process. The stats process can later be queried what's going on in
# the system. With imap_stats plugin you can get per-command level
# statistics for IMAP commands.
#
# There are different "zoom levels" you can look at the statistics:
#
# * command: Per-IMAP command
# * session: Per IMAP/POP3 connection
# * user: Per user (all of user's sessions summed up)
# * domain: Per domain (all of domain's users summed up)
# * ip: Per IP address (all sessions from the IP summed up)
# * global: Everything summed up (2.2.16+)

mail_plugins = $mail_plugins stats
protocol imap {
  mail_plugins = $mail_plugins imap_stats
}
plugin {
  # how often to session statistics (must be set)
  stats_refresh = 30 secs
  # track per-IMAP command statistics (optional)
  stats_track_cmds = yes
}

# You'll also need to give enough permissions for mail processes to be
# able to write to stats-mail fifo. For example if you use a single
# "vmail" user for mail access:
service stats {
  fifo_listener stats-mail {
    user = vmail
    mode = 0600
  }
}


# Memory usage configuration

# The stats process attempts to keep memory usage below a specified
# amount. This value is only approximate because of extra overhead
# caused by malloc() itself.

stats_memory_limit = 16 M

# Once the memory limit is reached, oldest statistics are freed from
# memory. Different statistics levels have different timeout limits,
# which are configured in:

stats_command_min_time = 1 mins
stats_domain_min_time = 12 hours
stats_ip_min_time = 12 hours
stats_session_min_time = 15 mins
stats_user_min_time = 1 hours

service stats {
  inet_listener {
    address = 127.0.0.1
    port = 24242
